# Custom Search Component for the task

This is an application with a slide-out and slide-in search bar that addresses an API to retrieve the data, and as a result of each search it shows a number of products retrieved. Clicking the search bar activates and extends it, while clicking out of it or pressing the **Search** button shrinks it, launching search according to the input data.

Pressing the **Clear** button gets the Navigation Chain cleared up to the root link. Also, pressing on a specific Navigation Link clears the links after itself. The program could be enhanced and additional logics could be implemented as well.

## Third party libraries in use:
* Alamofire
* SwiftyJSON
* Lottie

## Breadcrumbs implementation:
* Tag-based component
* Clickable navigation icons
* Clickable crumbs for navigation
